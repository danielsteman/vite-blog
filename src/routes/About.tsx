        Since a couple of years, I also have experience building frontend
        projects, mainly using React and Typescript. Although it's not my
        specialty, the rendering paradigms and opportunities to optimize web
        app performance interest me. Ultimately, I aim to be (backend-biased) full-stack, such that I can
        contribute to projects at any stage.
