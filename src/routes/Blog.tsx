      text: "Often, it's hard to observe moisture in soil, making it hard to judge whether your houseplants need water. This is a problem that can be countered with sensors. Of course, sensors need to be hooked up to a device to interpret and process signals. I was looking for a lightweight Arduino-like piece of hardware with integrated Wi-Fi and found the ESP8266.",
