# Taking ergonomics to the next level with the split CKBRD

&nbsp;

TBD

&nbsp;

Already a few months ago I entered the [rabbit hole]() of custom- ergo- mechanical- split keyboards and by now I built my own. I wanted to give the [ortholinear]() key layout a shot as I read many good things about it and it kind of made sense to me from an ergonomic perspective. The [diagonal layout]() of regular keyboards is still a legacy from typewriters and is inferior, [some claim](). Also I wanted to try a [layered key layout]() to save space and make the keyboard more compact so I can bring it around easily. I also like the idea of a layered layout because it will decrease the distance between keys and raise typing speed potential (which surely is a time investment to reach its full potential).

&nbsp;

After countless hours of research I decided to go with a wireless Corne Cherry v3. Its design is [open sourced]() and can be freely copied :smiley:. I ordered the following list of parts [here]():

&nbsp;

- PCB
- more...

&nbsp;

As the PCB design is open sourced you can basically order those parts at any PCB printing shop. The other parts are quite generic and widely available from other shops as well. After receiving the parts it was time to assemble the thing. You'll need a soldering iron and a steady hand to mount all the parts on the PCB. Without that much experience with soldering, this was quite doable, so don't let that discourage you. The Nice!Nano is really easy to flash, thanks to the [clear instructions and accompanied Github actions](), so you don't have to bother with building the firmware yourself. [This](https://github.com/danielsteman/ckbrd) is my clone, which contains the keymap in ``.

By now I can say that it definitely takes some time to get used to the Corne, but it definitely makes work more chill. A split keyboard makes it easier to keep a good posture for a longer amount of time working behind a desk. The layered keys make you want to have a monitor with the keymap open, because it really feels like relearning to type. This is also due to the ortholinear layout, which causes you to mistype sometimes. After you wrapped your brain around the new positions and keymaps, you'll notice the potential it has in terms of typing speed.
