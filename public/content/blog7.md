It's time to talk about the tech stack used for this website. Since some time I started with Rust because I was longing for a statically-typed language after doing a series of projects in Python and because I heared [so many good things](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#overview) about the language. However, it's tough a find a use case for Rust, as most companies haven't adopted it in their stack. Because of that, I decided to clone this tech blog using only Rust. Obviously, I wasn't the only one coming up with [this idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luOgEhLE2sg), so I won't take full credit. My weapons of choice for this assigned are [Yew](https://yew.rs/) and [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/), which make up the foundation for the frontend and backend, respectively.

Because this is the first "serious" Rust project I'm undertaking, I wanted to write about it, to share what I like about developing in Rust and why you should give it a shot but also about the obstacles you might encounter and how you can overcome them.
